This is the layout start for a photography website. 
Deliverables and descriptions are below:

Create Logo
Create website title
Index/landing page layout: 2 collumn layout
  The left aside will function as the navigation menu.
  Main container will emphasize the images that the photographer wants to showcase. 
Each category/collection will have it's own landing page image and then have a scroll function for remaining images. 
Later add media links for FB, Twitter, etc. (when photographer gets social media accounts up and running).
